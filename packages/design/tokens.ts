// Written by scripts/generate-tokens.mjs from tokens.css, which is the single

// `pnpm --filter @ding/design build`; editing this file is undone by the next
// generate, and CI fails when the two disagree.
//
// The web reads tokens.css directly through `var()`. React Native has no
// cascade, so it reads these — the same numbers, resolved: `var()` references
// followed, and `color-mix(…, transparent)` flattened to rgba.
