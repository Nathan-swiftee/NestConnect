/**
 * The NestConnect privacy policy: owner facts, content, and the rule that
 * decides whether it may be shown at all.
 *
 * Everything in the policy that describes what the software does is written
 * from the code (see docs/privacy-policy-draft.md for the file-by-file
 * grounding). Everything that is a fact about the *operator* — who they are,
 * where to write to them, how long they keep data, which optional services
 * their production deployment actually switches on — cannot be read from the
 * code, and is therefore an owner field below.
 *
 * Fail closed: until every owner field is resolved (non-null, non-empty, and
 * free of anything that looks like a placeholder), `resolvePolicy` answers
 * `pending` and the public page renders a neutral "being finalised" notice with
 * none of the draft text. There is no partial mode.
