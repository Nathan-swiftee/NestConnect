/**
 * Why a chime that was asked for sometimes doesn't happen.
 *
 * Both rules here were live bugs, and both are silent by construction — a
 * suspended AudioContext accepts every call in `playReceived` without throwing
 * and simply never makes a sound, so nothing appears in a console anywhere.
 * The report was "sometimes it dings and sometimes it doesn't", which is the
 * worst possible symptom: people stop trusting the sound and go back to
 * watching the screen.
