/**
 * Which of our numbers or addresses a reply goes out from.
 *
 * The rule has one copy, used by the server to actually send and by all three
 * clients to say what will be sent from. That is the whole point of it living
 * in the shared package: a composer that promises one number while the server
 * uses another is worse than a composer that says nothing.
 *
 * `inboxes` arrives oldest-first — the store's contract — and these lean on it.
