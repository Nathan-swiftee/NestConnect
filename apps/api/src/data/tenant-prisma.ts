/**
 * The Prisma client every workspace read and write goes through.
 *
 * Tenant isolation is enforced here, once, rather than in each of the store's
 * hundred-odd queries — a rule that has to be remembered in every query is a
 * rule that is eventually forgotten in one, and the one is enough. Every
 * operation on a workspace-owned model has the bound org added to its filter;
 * every create has its org checked or filled in. Nothing is bound → the query
 * throws. There is no default workspace to fall back to.
 *
 * Models own their tenant one of two ways:
 *  - DIRECT: they carry `orgId` themselves.
 *  - VIA: they belong to something that does — a message to its conversation, a
 *    session to its user — and are filtered through that relation.
 *
 * A model that is in neither list is refused outright. Adding a table to the
 * schema without deciding whose it is should break the build of whoever
 * touches it, not quietly become readable across workspaces.
 *
 * The few lookups that genuinely have to cross tenants (finding the user an
 * email address signs in as; the inbox an incoming webhook is addressed to)
 * use the unscoped client explicitly, as `root` in the store, so every one of
 * them can be found with a search.
