/**
 * Which organisation the code running right now is acting for.
 *
 * Every read and write of workspace data happens inside one of these. The
 * Prisma client that the store uses refuses to touch an org-owned table when
 * nothing is bound — it does not fall back to a default org — so a code path
 * that forgot to establish its tenant fails loudly in testing instead of
 * quietly reading the first workspace's data in production.
 *
 * How a tenant gets bound:
 *  - a signed-in request: the auth guard resolves the user from the verified
 *    token, and the TenantInterceptor runs the handler bound to that user's org;
 *  - a public request (a channel webhook, the chat widget, a password reset):
 *    the handler starts unbound and calls `bindTenant` once it has resolved,
 *    from something it can trust (an inbox matched by its channel key, a
 *    signed visitor token, a single-use token), whose workspace it is acting in;
 *  - background work (snooze sweep, Gmail polling, outbound retries): each item
 *    runs inside `runInTenant(itsOrgId, …)`.
 *
 * A request binds once. Binding a second, different org inside the same request
 * throws — nothing legitimate needs to act for two workspaces in one request,
 * and that is exactly the shape a cross-tenant bug would take.
