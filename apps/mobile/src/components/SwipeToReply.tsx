/**
 * `FULL` is where the arrow reaches full size; `COMMIT` is where letting go
 * actually starts a reply.
 *
 * COMMIT sits at ~80% of FULL, not at it. Two reasons, and both are about the
 * gesture being forgiving where it can afford to be:
 *
 *  - People release as they *reach* the end of a pull, not after holding it
 *    there, so a threshold at full size fires on the frame they're already
 *    easing back from. It reads as "the swipe didn't take", which is the worst
 *    outcome — you have to do it again, harder.
 *  - The pan doesn't claim the gesture until the finger has travelled
 *    `activeOffsetX`, and on some platforms translation is then reported from
 *    that point rather than from touch-down. Budgeting for the difference costs
 *    nothing; not budgeting for it makes an ordinary swipe a coin flip.
 *
 * 45pt is still well past the activation slop, so a scroll that drifts
 * sideways never trips it.

/**
 * Swipe a bubble to reply to it, the way WhatsApp does.
 *
 * Inbound swipes right and outbound swipes left — mirrored, because the gesture
 * pulls the message toward the middle of the screen from wherever it sits. A
 * reply arrow fades in and grows behind it, reaching full size at the commit
 * point, so the feedback tells you when you've pulled far enough before you let
 * go rather than after.
 *
 * The pan is claimed only once the finger has moved further horizontally than
 * vertically (`activeOffsetX` / `failOffsetY`), so a diagonal flick still
 * scrolls the thread instead of half-starting a reply.
 *
 * Runs on the UI thread through Reanimated: a gesture driven by React state
 * stutters on a long thread, which is exactly where people use it.
