          Animating the row's layout rather than a measured height on purpose:
          what a multiline TextInput reports through `onContentSizeChange`

            microphone fades it out in a single step.

            This is what makes the recording hint able to be transparent, and
            transparency is what stops the microphone disappearing. The hint
            used to be an opaque bar drawn over the row — a second pill inside
            the row's own — and the button travels up to 120 points left as you
            slide to cancel, so no amount of clearance kept it out from under
            that bar. Hiding what's underneath instead means nothing is ever
            drawn on top of the button at all.

            `pointerEvents` goes with the opacity: an invisible text field that
            still takes touches is a trap. */}
