/**
 * A photo or a video, full screen.

 * Tapping one used to call `Linking.openURL` on the media endpoint — which is
 * behind the session guard, and a URL handed to the OS carries no session. The
 * phone opened a browser, the browser got a 401, and the user got a blank page.
 * That was "opening photos and videos doesn't work".
 *
 * So nothing leaves the app. `mediaSource` attaches the bearer token as a
 * header, `<Image>` and `expo-video` both accept headers on a remote source,
 * and the file is fetched by the app that already has the credentials. The one
 * thing that does still go out to the system — Share, which needs a real file —
 * downloads it here first, with the header, and hands over the local copy.
