 *
 *  - **The entrance.** It pops out of nothing — scale 0 to a little past 1 and

 *    makes the row read as a row; the overshoot is what makes each one read as
 *    landing rather than fading up.
 *  - **The press.** Scale, not opacity. A 44pt target with a 24pt glyph in it
 *    has no visible edge to dim, so `active:opacity-60` mostly greys the emoji
 *    — which looks like it's disabled, not pressed. Shrinking it slightly is
 *    the same feedback WhatsApp gives and reads instantly at that size.
 *
 * The two multiply into one transform, so a press mid-entrance is composed with
