/**
 * The animated bottom sheet every sheet in the app is built on.
 *
 * React Native's own `animationType="slide"` was doing this before, and the
 * problem with it isn't that it looks bad — it's that it's a linear slide of a
 * fixed duration with a scrim that appears instantly. Nothing physical moves
 * like that, and next to a spring it reads as a slide *show*. This runs the
 * panel on a spring and cross-fades the scrim with it, so the sheet arrives the
 * way a sheet should: fast at first, then settling.
 *
 * The reason it's a shared component rather than a prop on each sheet is the
 * exit. A `Modal` unmounts the instant `visible` goes false, which kills any
 * exit animation before it starts — so the unmount has to be held back until
 * the animation has finished. That's fiddly, easy to get subtly wrong, and
 * there are six sheets in this app; doing it once is the only version of this
 * that stays correct.
 *
 * It also drags. A sheet that rises from the bottom edge and can then only be
 * dismissed by aiming at the scrim above it is saying two contradictory things:
 * it arrived like something physical, and it behaves like a dialog. Everything
 * else on a phone that comes up from the bottom goes back down when you push it
 * there — and on a tall sheet, reaching the scrim means moving your thumb past
 * the whole sheet to close it.
 *
 * ── One rule for anything you put inside ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * **A `ScrollView` in here must set `flexShrink: 1`** (or carry its own
 * `maxHeight`). The panel is capped at 85% of the screen, but Yoga defaults
 * `flexShrink` to 0, so a scroller with taller content keeps its full content
 * height, overflows the cap, and gets clipped. Clipped is not scrolled: the
 * ScrollView's frame equals its content, so as far as it knows there is nothing
 * to scroll to, and every drag inside it does nothing.
 *
 * That's what "the customer details pop-up scrolls sometimes" was — a short
 * contact fits inside the cap and looks fine, a long one silently can't move.
 * `flexShrink: 1` lets the scroller give back the height it can't have, which
 * leaves content taller than frame, which is the condition for scrolling.
 * `check:layout` enforces it.
