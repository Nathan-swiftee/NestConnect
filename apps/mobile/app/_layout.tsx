            bug we shipped for months, not a style preference.

            On Android the system bar insets arrive as WindowInsets and are
            passed down the view tree, and a view in the middle can consume them
            before anything below sees them. KeyboardProvider does exactly that
            when told the bars are translucent, so with it on the outside every
            `useSafeAreaInsets()` in the app answered zero: the chat header sat
            under the clock and the composer under the navigation bar, on every
            screen, since the first build. Nothing about it looks wrong in a
            browser, where there are no system bars to inset for.

            `initialMetrics` is the belt to that braces. It reads the insets
            synchronously from the native module at startup instead of waiting
            for the first measurement to come back, so the first frame is
            already correct — and a screen still gets real numbers even if the
            listener path fails again. */}

              out. That breaks the platform's own `adjustResize`: the window no
              longer shrinks when the keyboard opens, so anything anchored to the
              bottom — the composer — ends up underneath it. This provider is
              what restores it, reading the real keyboard frame and publishing it
              as animated values. Reanimated's useAnimatedKeyboard is deprecated
              in favour of exactly this. */}
