 * Narrowing applied on top of the chosen view, client-side — the web's set,

 * in. The views themselves live in the switcher, reached from the title.
 *
 * Two of the six are conditional, for the same reason they are on the web: a
 * filter that can only ever return everything or nothing is noise. "Yours" only
 * means something in a shared inbox where several agents' conversations sit
 * together; in "Mine" it is the whole view, and in "Queue" it is empty by
 * definition. "Groups" appears only once there is a group to filter to.
 *
 * Closed is the odd one out and has to be. A resolved conversation is excluded
 * from every other filter — including All, which means "all the live ones",
 * because a shift's worth of resolved threads at the top of the inbox is how
 * you lose the one that still needs you.
