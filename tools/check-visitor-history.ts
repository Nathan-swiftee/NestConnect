/**
 * Can a customer read their own past conversations — and only their own?
 *
 * Two halves, and the second is the reason this is a check rather than a test of
 * one method.
 *
 * The feature: a closed chat is never resumed — `threadFor` only ever joins an
 * open one — so the moment an agent resolved a thread it left the customer's
 * side entirely. They reopened the chat, found an empty box, and everything
 * agreed about their order was readable only by the business. The app had no
 * endpoint that could even ask.
 *
 * The danger: the thing being added is "fetch a conversation by id" on a public,
 * unauthenticated surface, where the id is a string a stranger sends. Everything
 * standing between that and any thread in the database is two comparisons
 * against a signed token. So the refusals are checked as carefully as the
 * reads — another customer's thread, another channel's thread, and an internal
 * note inside one of their own.
 *
